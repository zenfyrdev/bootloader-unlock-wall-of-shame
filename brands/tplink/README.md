# TP-Link/Neffos

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

It’s surprising that a company best known for its routers never complicated or restricted bootloader unlocking on it`s smartphones.

TP-LINK/Neffos devices can be unlocked using the generic fastboot method.
And even though TP-Link discontinued its smartphone line and disbanded the Neffos division, **all previously released models can still be unlocked because the process is fully offline** and doesn’t rely on any manufacturer servers.

This is a great example of why offline bootloader unlocking is important.
