# Shift 

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

Shift Phones (https://www.shift.eco/) can be unlocked via fastboot without any codes. The only requirement is 
to enable **OEM unlocking** in **Developer Options** settings page ([standard procedure](https://github.com/zenfyrdev/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame/blob/main/misc/generic-unlock.md)). Shift also provides test devices, kernel sources and camera and other device-specific software as much as possible to allow custom ROM's as their selling point. They also provide the email address [devrel@shiftphones.com](mailto:devrel@shiftphones.com) for CustomOS developers.
