* Verdict **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**
* Global phones or Chinese phones released with ColorOS 15 or older: [**🔓️ Unlock Guide**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)

## Global phones and older Chinese models
All OnePlus phones on the global market, and any Chinese models that were initially released with ColorOS 15 or older, can be easily unlocked using the [standard procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md). This includes devices that have since updated to ColorOS 16.0 or newer.

## Newer Chinese phones initially released with ColorOS 16.0 and above
According to the [OnePlus forum](https://bbs.oneplus.com/thread/1926504022886318086), for phones and tablets sold in mainland China, unlocking the bootloader is **only possible via an official application to join the “Deep Testing” program**.

**Main requirements:**  
- Account must be in good standing (no violations or restrictions)  
- No application submitted in the past 30 days  
- Device is not a corporate or carrier-customized model  

> **Note:** These restrictions currently apply only to devices sold in mainland China. However, due to the unified OPPO–OnePlus codebase, similar restrictions may be introduced for global models in the future.

## T-Mobile
For OnePlus devices purchased from T-Mobile or an MVNO such as Metro, even if the device was later unlocked from T-Mobile, they require an [unlock token], and to get your unlock token, you need to provide original proof of purchase from T-Mobile. If you purchased the device second-hand, e.g. from eBay, you will not be able to unlock your bootloader. This does not apply to the OnePlus 6 or earlier.
