# Oukitel 

- Verdict: **⛔ Avoid!**
* Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!** (Unisoc)
* [**🔓️ Unlock Guide (MediaTek)**](../../misc/generic-unlock.md)


Oukitel used to follow the [standard unlock procedure](../../misc/generic-unlock.md) for their MediaTek devices, however at some unknown point, they began blocking unlocks on all devices. Unisoc devices cannot be unlocked, this is *not* Oukitel's fault, Unisoc does not allow unlocking.
