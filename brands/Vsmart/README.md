# Vsmart

- Verdict: **🍅 Terrible!**

Vsmart (VinSmart) devices are currently unable to be unlocked after the company's exit from the mobile market in May 2021 and the subsequent shutdown of all verification servers. But early models (e.g., Active 1/1+) running VOS 2.5 or lower supported standard fastboot unlocking , the release of VOS 3.0 had removed the "OEM Unlocking" option and started server-dependent restrictions that are now impossible to bypass . So, most modern devices like the Aris, Live 4, and Joy 4 remain permanently locked, with the only way to unlock is to use MTKClient for Mediatek model. <br/>
